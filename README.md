Project Overview
Urban parking lots often use static pricing, leading to overcrowding or underutilization. This project builds a dynamic pricing engine for 14 
parking spaces using real-time data streams to optimize utilization based on demand, queue, traffic, and competition.

1.Base price fixed at $10, bounded between 0.5xâ€“2x to ensure realistic variations.

2.Uses only numpy, pandas, Pathway, Bokeh as per project constraints.

3.Models built from scratch without external ML libraries to demonstrate fundamental understanding.

4.Smooth and explainable pricing logic, avoiding erratic jumps.

5.Optional rerouting system implemented for customer satisfaction and efficient lot utilization.
